        "text": "Questo esercizio è molto simile alla panca normale con bilanciere tranne per il fatto che prevede di utilizzare una press machine a peso libero inclinata e la parte superiore del torace sarà il gruppo muscolare che lavora, anziché il petto al centro. Solleva il bilanciere fuori dai ganci e abbassare lentamente a circa 3 centimetri sopra la clavicola (appena sotto il pomo d\"Adamo) e poi spingi la barra di nuovo nella posizione di partenza. NON FAR TOCCARE LA BARRA SULLA PARTE SUPERIORE DEL TORACE (questo provoca stress non necessari sulle articolazioni della spalla e porta via la tensione dai muscoli pettorali superiori, che sono ciò che noi vogliamo fare lavorare!). Assicurati, quando stai abbassando la barra, che tu lo faccia in modo lento e controllato. Al contrario, quando spingi la barra verso l\"alto, fallo in modo esplosivo.",
